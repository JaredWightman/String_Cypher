# Overview

This project is a console program encrypts and decrypts strings. The console takes a seed input makes a substitution key. Using the resulting key, it can encrypt a string (console input or predetermined file) and decrypt it.

I wrote this program to learn the basics of Rust and for a basic understanding about encryption.

# Future Work

- Make GUI instead of using console
- Learn more about and implement Cargo
- Allow for more file reading/writing options 
- Create an actual algorithm, not just hard-coded loops doing substitution
